# Telegram Stream

A gardener does not only write and curate in their garden, often content flows into the garden via a stream. This is a Telegram stream. Simply message or forward any piece of content and it will populate in your garden! 

Thank you to [dimonier/tg2obsidian](https://github.com/dimonier/tg2obsidian) for the initial structure and bot. 

In order to have this as a functioning stream 
- Git based sync needs to be added (right now everything is local file paths)
